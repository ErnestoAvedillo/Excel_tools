## Background
During my all working life I have generated several tools in excel. 
This Repository pretends to be a summary of all of them.


## List of tools
## 1) Sprint Excel sheet calculation
### Description
	The market is plain of programms to calculate spring efforts, but I never found any one to be used in a general platform as EXCEL. 
	The objective of this Spring Excel file is to give a universal tool to calculate in an easy way a spring with the normalised materials that can be found in the market.
	At the moment all materials introduced are according to DIN spec.
	I generate the Goodman diagram. This has been calculated acording to the information obtained in the DIN spec. In case any one is interested in helping me to make a better way of calculation it will be appreciated.
	
### Documentation
	Documentation is stil under development.

## 2) Modify or resume from multiple excell sheets
### Description
	Did you ever had to modify or retrieve data from multiple excel sheets?
	In case yes, I am sure that you had typo errors.
	With this tool you will be able to collect data just selecting the files and giving the name of the sheet and cell.

### Documentation
	Documentation is stil under development.

## 3) Formulary filler
### Description 
	Very similar problem I have when I need to fill multiple Excel formularies. 
	When I need to fill 10, 20 formularies, I use this tool that saves me several time.
	With this file you can select the Excell to be filled, rename it as you want and finally fill every document with the information that you need.

### Documentation
